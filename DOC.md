There are no extra steps necessary to run this application.
It only needs an internet connection for the first build,
like all other flutter applications.

Minor iisues:
    - Splash screen displays only app logo, so a custom splash screen will have to be implemented
    - Custom grid_view rebuild issue. Package author has noted that it will be fixed in an upcoming update.
